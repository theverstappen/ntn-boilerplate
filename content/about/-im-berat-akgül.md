## What I Do for a Living

* I collect and share knowledge as a [keynote speaker](https://www.lengstorf.com/speaking), principal developer experience engineer at [Netlify](https://netlify.com/?utm_source=lengstorf-com&utm_medium=about-jl&utm_campaign=devex), and through [my blog](https://www.lengstorf.com/blog).
* I find brilliant people and learn from them in public on *[Learn With Jason](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/)*, a live show where I pair program to learn something new in 90 minutes.
* I create better teams by focusing on effective working habits, including such world-shattering techniques as [“actually taking time off”](https://www.lengstorf.com/overtime-hurts-productivity).
* I make the people around me more effective by [identifying the dirt floors](https://www.lengstorf.com/dirt-floors), then helping design ways to remove them.

## What I Do for Fun

* Write. Usually I tell stories about how I used to be a shitbag, and try to share the lessons I learned to make me less of a shitbag.
* Cook. I love figuring out new ways to create meals, and I love having friends over for a family-style meal.
* Code. Before it was the way I made a living, I built things for the web for fun. Sometimes I still [build silly things on the internet](https://whichbeardisthis.com/).
